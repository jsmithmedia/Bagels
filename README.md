# Bagels

This is a game called "Pico, Fermi, Bagel" or "Bagels" as it is referred to here. I made this game as a project in a
computer science course at UGA. You can read the basic rules below, I hope you enjoy it!

The object of the game is to guess a secret number. The responses to your guesses will clue you in
as to what your next guess should be.

  If the guess has no numbers correct, the computer will respond: "Bagel."
  
  For each digit the guess has correct, but in the wrong place, the computer will respond: "Pico."
  
  For each digit the guess has correct and in the correct place, the computer will respond respond: "Fermi."
  
Good luck!
